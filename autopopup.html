This easy to use program will allow you to concentrate on what's happening in the game, rather than what happened last play! To record everything in the game, use the Current Play tab. At any point, you can switch to the Inning Summary tab to see the "scorebook" that you are used to using. Have fun and good luck!

Please enter a filename where you would like to save your game. SoftballScores will save your game automatically every 60 seconds!<br><br>
